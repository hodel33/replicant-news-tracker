# Replicant News Tracker


## üìã Overview

Replicant News Tracker is a terminal-based app designed to provide insightful analytics from various news sources. It scrapes news articles, processes the textual data by removing stopwords and punctuations, and stores the refined content in an SQLite database. Utilizing Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, the application generates meaningful charts to offer valuable insights into the news landscape.

### üåü Features

- **Multi-Source News Scraping:** Supports scraping from multiple news outlets (user-defined configurations for targeted scraping).
- **Comprehensive HTML Filtering**: The scraping process employs flexible, regular-expression-based filtering to selectively extract relevant article content, while excluding irrelevant information like image captions, promotional texts, or any unwanted tags. It also checks for a minimum paragraph count, ensuring that only substantial articles are processed further.
- **Text Processing:** Cleans article text by removing stopwords and punctuations.
- **SQLite Storage:** Utilizes a custom SQLite context manager for efficient database operations.
- **Insightful Data Analysis:** In-depth analytics, offering visualizations for top keywords, categories, keyword trends over time, and geographical mentions. It categorizes articles by domain and date, and performs comprehensive keyword counting to offer unique insights into your scraped articles.
- **Interactive HTML Graphs:** Generate and interact with various dynamic plots including bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps for enhanced data visualization and analysis.
- **Pagination Support:** The scraper efficiently handles HTML pagination and dynamically adjusts the scraping URL to fit the structure of each different website.
- **Keyword Filtering:** Comes with predefined categories and keywords for specialized article analysis, while also allowing users to add their own custom keywords and categories.
- **Scheduled Runs:** Comes with batch files for automated, scheduled runs on Windows and macOS/Linux.
- **Error Handling/Logging:** Features robust error-handling mechanisms including exponential backoff in its retry logic for efficient handling of transient errors and rate limits. Additionally, meaningful errors and logs are generated for exceptional situations.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) integrated with custom-designed real-time progress bars, thanks to the tqdm package. These progress bars are tailored to match the CLI design and are visible during all scraping activities, chart generation, and data calculations, elevating the overall user experience.

## üîß Usage (Configuration)

### Site Scraping Configurations

> **Note:** This scraper is designed to work only on news websites that are free and do not require subscription models.

The scraper is highly configurable and designed to work with multiple news outlets. Below is a sample configuration for a news site found in `data_init.py`.

```python
{
  "domain": "vox.com",
  "pages": ["/", "/world-politics"],
  "url_filter": r"/\d+/\d+/\d+/",
  "url_exclusion": ["/videos/", "/podcasts/"],
  "div_filter": r"c-entry-content",
  "p_attr_exclusion": ["c-article", "amount", "contributed", "c-read-more"],
  "pagin_filter": "c-pagination"
}
```

- **domain**: The base URL of the news site.
- **pages**: The specific pages to scrape ("/" is the main page).
- **url_filter**: A regular expression to identify article URLs.
- **url_exclusion**: Filters for URLs to be excluded.
- **div_filter**: A regular expression filter used to identify the HTML class or ID containing the main article content.
- **p_attr_exclusion**: A list of HTML classes or IDs to exclude when scraping the article content. Useful for ignoring paragraphs that contain advertisements, promotional links, or other non-relevant information.
- **pagin_filter**: A filter to identify pagination links on the web page. The scraper first attempts to find a match using a regular expression. If that fails, it looks for an "aria-label" attribute in the "a" tag. Finally, if both methods fail, it looks for a class name that contains a "?" in its href attribute.

<br>

## üîÑ Usage (Batch run)

> **Note:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute these scripts.

The scraper comes with a batch run feature that allows you to run scraping operations automatically at scheduled times. Below are the setup details for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Windows

1. Locate the `scheduled_scraper.bat` file in the project directory.
2. Double-click on the batch file to run it, or schedule it using Windows Task Scheduler.

**Content of `scheduled_scraper.bat`:**

```batch
@echo off
python.exe "%~dp0\scheduled_scraper.py"
```

### macOS/Linux

1. Locate the `scheduled_scraper.sh` file in the project directory.
2. Open Terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `chmod +x scheduled_scraper.sh`.
3. Use `cron` or another scheduler to set up the script to run at your desired intervals.

**Content of `scheduled_scraper.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 "$(dirname "$0")/scheduled_scraper.py"
```

### Logging

After the batch run is completed, the application will log the number of new articles stored in the database, along with the ones that were omitted. This information is saved in a file called `scheduled_scraper.txt` in the following format:

```text
------------------
2023-09-03 14:15
------------------
Successfully stored 20 new article(s) in the database (3 were omitted).
```

To enable this feature, make sure the `batch` parameter is set to `True` when calling the `scrape_all_sites` method from `scheduled_scraper.py`.

```python
ns = NewsScraper()
ns.scrape_all_sites(pagin_amount=5, debug_mode=False, batch=True)
```

<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

The scraper features a verbose Debug Mode for advanced troubleshooting and development purposes. When activated, this mode provides real-time logs for each crucial step of the scraping process. This includes:

- The status code for each HTTP request.
- The current pagination level.
- The dynamic modification of pagination URLs for the next scraping iteration.
- The number of paragraphs found in the main content area.
- Attributes of each paragraph for spotting unnecessary promotional texts or other unwanted content.

To enable Debug Mode, simply set the `debug_mode` parameter to `True` when calling the `scrape_all_sites` method.

```python
self.scrape_all_sites(pagin_amount=input_pagin_amount, debug_mode=True)
```

This feature is particularly helpful for identifying issues such as missing or empty content, incorrect URL patterns, or understanding how the scraper navigates through pagination and filters out irrelevant information.<br>
Example:

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Scraping process halts unexpectedly or skips specific domains/pages.  
**Solution**: Refer to the "scraper_log.txt" logs for any error messages. For a more detailed examination, enable Debug Mode.

**Issue**: Some articles are not saved in the database and are instead placed in the "exclude_articles" table.  
**Solution**: Verify the `div_filter` and `p_attr_exclusion` settings for each website in `data_init.py`. It's also possible that some articles lack sufficient quality content to warrant saving.

![Articles Ommited Screenshot](readme_screens/articles_omitted.png)

**Issue**: HTML chart plots are not displaying as expected.  
**Solution**: Make sure you are using the latest version of your web browser and have JavaScript enabled.

**Issue**: Scheduled scraping runs are not executing.  
**Solution**: Confirm that the batch files are set up correctly and that you have the required permissions to execute them.
